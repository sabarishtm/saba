Bradley and Nolan recognize that the ability of an organization to sense change and the agility in the appropriate response determines its success or eventual demise. External change has always been a constant threat to the stability of any organization – including economy, political landscape, competition or customer sentiment. However, advances in technology have accelerated its impact manifold today. This dictates that organizations need to be acutely aware of the change and stay nimble in their ability to adapt or respond to the change. Chesbrough’s Open Innovation theory advocates one method to acquire much-needed dexterity. Open innovation is a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as the firms look to advance their technology.

Cognizant a global IT services major, through customer dialogues sensed a burgeoning demand for BPM[1] software in 2003. It responded quickly, building a partnership with Pegasystems, then an unknown workflow software company. Sensing the market need, and the skillful response through open innovation has made Cognizant the market leader in BPM implementations[2].
