title: SUCCEEDING AT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
---

In the past few years, there has been an accelerated the trend toward a focus on products rather than services in Information Technology (IT). Traditional project-based delivery models are neither nimble nor scalable enough to realizing the digital transformation goals of an organization.
Product management entails shifting the focus from the creation to the consumption side of IT. The related funding encourages the rapid development and deployment of long-lasting customer obsessed products.
In conventional project-based IT, departments created software by working their way through to-do lists, keeping tabs on spending, and monitoring progress against precisely calculated schedules. These delivery models ignored the organization's overarching strategy and road map in favor of a more regimented approach.
The key to successfully transforming IT organizations and service delivery models is to embrace an agile framework of working, establishing the right roles and responsibilities, and cultivating the right technology and business talent.

# Adapt and Adopt Agile Frameworks!
In contrast to the strict and often unyielding approach of project managed IT projects, agile approaches consider the fact that requirements are not always clear at the outset and that tasks frequently extend beyond their original scope and timeframe.
Traditionally, projects are managed by first defining all the requirements, followed by the design, development, and testing of the software â€“ a classical WATERFALL approach. The approach's flaw is that it presumes all requirements can be known in advance, which is rarely the case. 

## Motivate Your Teams with Well-Defined Metrics.
The focus of product-centric IT is on the end user, rather than the production process. To achieve this, businesses must create metrics that encourage employees to center their efforts on business results rather than IT output.
To begin establishing metrics for IT departments, "PRODUCTIVITY" is often the first word that comes to mind. Conventional methods of gauging personal or group efficiencies spread and normalize harmful actions.
For instance, focusing on the number of lines of code leads to inefficient code that needs more testing. Tracking the quantum of implemented prevent critical ones from being shipped first. The emphasis shifts unconsciously from innovation and architecture improvements to "patching" code as incident resolution becomes the primary metric.
Rather, teams should be incentivized to promote the desired outcomes for the organization. First, businesses need to determine the true value of their products and services to customers, and only then can they create key performance indicators (KPIs) to track how effectively they are delivering on that value.

# Right Roles and Responsibilities
Horse of courses, or the right person for the right role. Often organizations are guilty of rebranding existing project management roles to their adjacent agile product management roles. Despite the best intentions of the organization to retain the valuable talent and tribal knowledge of the team members, this leads to confusion and results into relapses to old ways of working. In the absence of proper re-training of the associates, results in a series of mini waterfalls than a true iterative Agile delivery.
I have compiled a list of key roles that can make or break a transformation storyline. These characters can determine if history will recognize these valiant program efforts as a tragedy or a victory.
The more significant roles amongst these are the Product Owners, Business SMEs, Full Stack Developers, DevOps engineers, and Site Reliability Engineers. The empowerment and autonomy granted to these individuals ensure the transparency and agility of operations. For example,
## Product Owners
The product, rather than the project, is now the unit of delivery. Empowering product owners and managers to own and make significant product and service-related decisions is crucial. These individuals are responsible and accountable for the program scope, return on investment, market positioning, and growth of the business line.
Similarly, educating and empowering every individual and role on the business drivers, goals and including them in the feedback loop is essential.
