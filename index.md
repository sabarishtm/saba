In the past few years, there has been an accelerated the trend toward a focus on products rather than services in Information Technology (IT). Traditional project-based delivery models are neither nimble nor scalable enough to realizing the digital transformation goals of an organization.
Product management entails shifting the focus from the creation to the consumption side of IT. The related funding encourages the rapid development and deployment of long-lasting customer obsessed products.
In conventional project-based IT, departments created software by working their way through to-do lists, keeping tabs on spending, and monitoring progress against precisely calculated schedules. These delivery models ignored the organization's overarching strategy and road map in favor of a more regimented approach.
The key to successfully transforming IT organizations and service delivery models is to embrace an agile framework of working, establishing the right roles and responsibilities, and cultivating the right technology and business talent.

# ADAPT AND ADOPT AGILE FRAMEWORKS! 
In contrast to the strict and often unyielding approach of project managed IT projects, agile approaches consider the fact that requirements are not always clear at the outset and that tasks frequently extend beyond their original scope and timeframe.
Traditionally, projects are managed by first defining all the requirements, followed by the design, development, and testing of the software â€“ a classical WATERFALL approach. The approach's flaw is that it presumes all requirements can be known in advance, which is rarely the case.
